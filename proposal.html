    <h2>Problem Statement and Pain Points</h2> 
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
      At present, with the increase in the types and numbers of various examinations in society and the surge in the number of participants, whether a good learning environment can be obtained has become an urgent problem for all preparation groups. However, except school students, it is difficult for graduates and employed people to obtain a quiet, competitive study atmosphere and an excellent learning environment where can study for a long time without being disturbed like school libraries and study rooms. Besides，Students also have many self-study tasks during the holidays and this kind of environment is needed to ensure high learning efficiency. Therefore, after 2018, a large number of shared study rooms have appeared in the market, and they have grown rapidly to meet social needs.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
      However, at present, the channels for people to obtain information are limited to apps such as Meituan, Dianping, etc. or WeChat public platforms, acquaintance recommendations and so on. The degree of information obtained is well-structured and cannot respond to user pain points (such as whether there is a reading room allowing people read aloud, self-printing equipment, and whether there is a take-out dining area, or whether two people can study at the same table, whether the environment is quiet and elegant enough, whether it can be study overnight etc.), which will cause a lot of confusion for users when choosing a study room in the early stage, and mostly users tend to book a long period (a week or more) when booking a self-study room to meet their long-term preparation work, so the selecting process could be really important.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
      I am going to focus on students and young people who are preparing for college or postgraduate school entrance examinations or some other essential exams like these two. This system aims to establish a well information-structured exploring shared study room system for this user group in Beijing, focusing on responding to the actual pain points of users when deciding a study room meeting their needs, rather than provide a system limited to general information such as price and location, so that could effectively help users eventually.

      *keyservice: services respond to customer painpoints(such as whether there is a reading room allowing people read aloud, self-printing equipment, and whether there is a take-out dining area, or whether two people can study at the same table, whether the environment is quiet and elegant enough, whether it can be study overnight etc.)
