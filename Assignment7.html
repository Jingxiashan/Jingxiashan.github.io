    <h2>Problem Statement</h2> 
    
    <h3>Persona</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
      The target user is a group of young people aged 18-25 who are preparing for postgraduate exams, IELTS, TOEFL, teacher qualification exams, civil servants and other major exams in Beijing. The user groups include college students, college graduates who have no job, and young people who have just entered the job. The purpose is to quickly find a shared study room that can study for a long time and has a good learning environment and learning atmosphere to prepare for the exam (this type of exam has obvious periodic, that is, it takes one to two months or six months to concentrate on studying efficiently), and the income status is no income or low to middle income.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Pain Points</h3>
    <ul class="ui list">
      <li>The information about shared study room from current platforms is not well-structured and cannot respond to user real needs</li>
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
        For example, whether there is a reading room allowing people read aloud, self-printing equipment, and whether there is a take-out dining area, or whether two people can study at the same table, whether the environment is quiet and elegant enough, whether it can be study overnight etc., that is, there is no proper labelling or classification mechanism in these systems, which will cost a lot of time for users to choose a study room they need in the early stage.
      </p>
      
      <li>Unable to meet users’ deeper learning needs, such as finding a partner who is preparing for the same exam to prepare together in order to communicate with and encourage each other</li>
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
        At present, the Meituan and Dianping platforms only provide users with an aggregation platform of business information, and cannot provide deeper services. For example, in this scenario, the platform can only provide the store information of the shared study room for users to browse and choose, and cannot achieve user social needs based on learning purposes, such as finding a learning partner who are preparing for the same exam. The ultimate goal of users who choose to  study in a shared study room is actually to achieve success in the exam, and obtaining a learning partner can gain mental support and exchange learning experience. The platform cannot provide related functions-that is, collecting specific user requirements for learning partners and realizing the matching of them.
      </p>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Needs and Objectives</h3>
    <ul class="ui list">
      <li>Shorten the path for users to find the target shared study room</li>
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
      For example, provide a unified and structured description for each shared study room, and provide a search mechanism based on the common needs of users (such as providing study tables for two people, self-printing services, reading rooms, and take-out dining areas). And optimize the user experience of finding a study room that meets their requirements  from product and front-end perspective.
      </p>

      <li>Provide social functions based on learning purposes</li>
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
        Collect user requirements for learning partners and publish them on the relevant interface in the form of "bulletin boards". Other users can browse and actively contact each other to achieve matching of learning partners.
      </p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results and reflection</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
      During the survey, people involved in this research were asked to complete the following tasks: the first step is to clarify their basic requirements for the study room and the priority of each need; the second step is to find a study room that meets their requirements in the Meituan (completion criteria: after online confirmation, you will go directly to the offline study room to investigate or study); the third step (optional), if you need to find a learning partner, you can use any means to find a learning partner that meets your needs (completion criteria: find your partner and get his/her contact information).
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
      Among the 5 subjects in this survey, sample 1 is a college student preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination who has not experienced the shared study room; sample 2 is a college student preparing for the IELTS examination who has experienced the shared study room; sample 3 is a college graduate preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination who has experienced the shared study room before; sample 4 is a college graduate having experienced the shared study room and preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination; sample 5 is a college graduate who has experienced the shared study room at the stage of preparing examination for the civil servant.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
      As far as the first step is concerned, the five respondents’ requirements for the target study room and the priority of their needs are very clear to them, focusing on wireless network speed, privacy of personal learning space, infrastructure, price, geographical location, etc. During the investigation, all five people could directly describe their basic requirements for the study room. In the second part, the operating procedures of the five survey subjects are: open the Meituan app-search for "study room" or "shared study room" in the search bar-browse and view the details of the study room, at this stage , The question generally reported by survey respondents is: Meituan platform has responded to some very basic needs, such as geographic location and price, on the returned search results, but has not directly responded to some of their other higher priority needs, such as network speed, the privacy of the personal learning space, whether there is a reading room, etc., users can only choose from some stores that meet their basic needs, such as those within the price range that they accept, to view the details one by one or call to inquire.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
      Due to the above reasons, 5 investigators usually finished the steps of browsing the shops on the platform within 3-5 minutes, and entered the steps of viewing details and calling for inquiries. This part took about 10 minutes for the respondents. The shortest one is 6min (calling 2 stores), and the longest is 13min (calling 4 stores).
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
      At the same time, in the third step of the survey, 3 out of 5 respondents hoped to find a learning partner, and the remaining 2 tended to study alone. The three survey subjects used the functions of WeChat group where there are other people who are also preparing for the same examination, Weibo city search, and Weibo super-topic to find their learning partners. Among them, only sample 1 found qualified partners in his WeChat group and got the partner's WeChat contact information, the other two did't find their partners within the time.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
      In interview phase after test, for the social functions based on learning purposes, all three survey respondents said that they were willing to publish the message containing their contact information to look for a learning partner in a location similar to the website bulletin board, and expected such a functional module in this kind website.
